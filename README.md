### The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system. (Forrester, 1971)

### World model can be trained quickly in an unsupervised manner to learn a compressed spatial and temporal representation of the environment. (World Models, 2018)
